# Fires before get_node. Two jobs:
#
# 1. Generic node-config reminder. Fires once per session (deduped by marker).
# 2. High-risk-node-specific reminders: Set, Code, Merge, splitInBatches
#    (Loop Over Items), DateTime, dataTable, and the LangChain Agent. These fire
#    EVERY time the agent looks up the node type, not just once per session. A
#    re-lookup of one of these is almost always the agent reconsidering ANOTHER
#    instance of the antipattern; once-per-session dedup would miss every
#    decision after the first.
#
# n8n-mcp's get_node takes a single SHORT-form node type, e.g. nodes-base.set or
# nodes-langchain.agent, in .tool_input.nodeType (not an array like the official
# get_node_types). The anchored regexes below match the short form.

  WARNINGS+="Before configuring this node, invoke the n8n-node-configuration skill via the Skill tool. Configuration is operation-aware: required fields depend on the resource/operation pair, and displayOptions control which fields are even visible. Never assume parameter names; confirm them against the get_node definition you're about to fetch. For interpreting any validation results afterward, n8n-validation-expert."

# High-risk-node warnings: NOT deduped. Each lookup fires the warning fresh.

  WARNINGS+="

[Set node detected]
STOP and invoke the n8n-expression-syntax skill via the Skill tool. The most common antipattern in n8n: a Set / Edit Fields node feeding only ONE downstream consumer.

If this Set node's only job is to map fields for the next node (before a Data Table insert, an email/Slack body, a Respond to Webhook, an HTTP body), delete it and put the expressions DIRECTLY in the next node's parameter slots. Those slots are expressions too. A Set node earns its place only when 2+ downstream consumers reference the same derived value, or as the FINAL return-shape node of a sub-workflow (the implicit consumer is every caller). See also n8n-node-configuration for field configuration."
fi

if matches '(^|\.)code$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[Code node detected]
Invoke the n8n-code-javascript skill via the Skill tool before writing a Code node. Decision order: expression first, then an arrow function inside Edit Fields, then a Code node only if neither can do the job. Default to JavaScript; use Python (n8n-code-python) only when the user explicitly asked; code an AI agent will call is a different runtime (n8n-code-tool). Much of what looks like a Code-node job has a native node instead (Crypto, XML, HTTP Request pagination) or belongs in an expression — the skill covers which, so route there rather than reaching for Code by reflex."
fi

if matches '(^|\.)merge$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[Merge node detected]
STOP and invoke the n8n-node-configuration skill via the Skill tool. Two silent failure modes:

1. Merge defaults to 2 inputs. If 3+ sources converge here, set numberOfInputs explicitly to match, or the third+ sources silently drop at runtime even though the connection lines are drawn.
2. The input index pairing is easy to wire backwards; off-by-one passes data from the wrong branch with no error. For wiring mistakes that survive into runtime, n8n-validation-expert."
fi

if matches '(^|\.)splitInBatches$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[Loop Over Items (splitInBatches) detected]
STOP and invoke the n8n-code-javascript skill (loop patterns) and n8n-workflow-patterns (batch architecture) via the Skill tool.

First question: do you actually need this? Default per-item iteration probably handles your case WITHOUT a Loop Over Items node, just connect the source to the consumer. Loop Over Items is for rate limiting (process N at a time with a Wait between), chunked bulk API calls, per-batch error handling, or polling a long-running job. Output index trap: output 0 is DONE (fires once at the end), output 1 is LOOP (fires per batch). Easy to wire backwards."
fi

if matches '(^|\.)dateTime$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[DateTime node detected]
Invoke the n8n-expression-syntax skill via the Skill tool first. Date math, formatting, and parsing usually work inline with Luxon at the consumer field, with no separate node:
  {{ DateTime.fromISO(\$('Source').item.json.created_at).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd') }}
  {{ DateTime.now().minus({ days: 7 }).toISO() }}
Reach for the DateTime node only when an inline expression genuinely can't express the transform."
fi

if matches '(^|\.)dataTable$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[Data Table node detected]
STOP and invoke n8n-node-configuration and n8n-workflow-patterns via the Skill tool. Gotchas that catch people:

1. id, createdAt, updatedAt are SYSTEM-MANAGED. Don't declare them; they always exist and can be used in queries.
2. Column types are primitives only: string / number / boolean / date. No JSON/object/array column types. For nested data, use a string column with JSON.stringify() on write and JSON.parse() on read.
3. Map fields DIRECTLY in the Insert node's per-column slots. Do NOT add a Set node before the Data Table node to 'shape' the input.
For the n8n_manage_datatable tool itself (CRUD, filtering, dry-run), see n8n-mcp-tools-expert."
fi

if matches 'nodes-langchain\.agent$'; then
  WARNINGS+="

[AI Agent node detected]
Invoke the n8n-agents skill via the Skill tool. Tool names and descriptions ARE part of the prompt the model routes against — generic ones degrade tool selection. The model/memory/tools/output-parser sub-node slots, structured output (use autoFix), memory + sessionId continuity, and chat anti-loop filtering all have traps. Custom Code tools attached to the agent have their own runtime contract: n8n-code-tool."
